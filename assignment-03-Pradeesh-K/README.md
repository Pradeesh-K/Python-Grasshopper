# Assignment

## 1 - Mesh traverse

Define a function for traversing a mesh from boundary to boundary in a "straight" line and
visualise the result. Fill in the missing code in the Python component in the ghx file [assignment_1_mesh_traverse.ghx](assignment/assignment_1_mesh_traverse.ghx).

The expected output (with the start key as 1) should look as follows:

| output mesh traverse |
| ---- |

## 2 - Network traverse

Define a function for traversing the network from one leaf to the furthest leaf and visualise the result. 
Fill in the missing code in the Python component in the ghx file [assignment_2_network_traverse.ghx](assignment/assignment_2_network_traverse.ghx).

The expected output (with the start key as 20) should look as follows:

| output network traverse |
| ---- |
| <img src="images/network_traverse.jpeg" width="440px" a/> |

In some newer Compas versions there might be an issue with the Network Artist. In this case, use [assignment_2_network_traverse_workaround_networkartist.ghx](assignment/assignment_2_network_traverse_workaround_networkartist.ghx), otherwise you can ignore that file.
